## Audio Catcher

Uh, this will play the Unreal Tournament announcer's famous "Headshot" audio clip when your `netcat` listener catches a connection. None of this code is good, but it is necessary. 

All testing done on Kali, with a default `root` user. 

## Installation

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Bashrc Alias??
`alias nc="/usr/bin/python3 <path to AudioCatcher.py>"`
